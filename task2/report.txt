There is no overbooking because:
- For each conveyor belt there is only one truck associated;
- We use a producer that sends packages with a given (random) size to all the belts through a channel;
- Trucks and belts operate concurrently but are isolated in their state management. This ensures that a package is only sent to a belt when explicitly requested and each truck processes its own packages without interference from others;
- The producer, belts and trucks communicate with messages between processes.

All this aspects ensure that there is no overbooking on package sending.

Additional functionality -> package size:
In the previous task we used a fixed size of 2. In this task we simply use a rand:uniform to generate a random number between 0 and the truck capacity.

Note: We have a scan for the user to indicate the number of conveyor belts and the maximum capacity of each truck.
